### DESIGN

**Colour Scheme**

The following colour scheme has been chosen for this project:

 - #FF4500 - OrangeRed. Red is a powerful colour that can have a huge visual impact if used correctly. The colour can represent passion and is known for engaging customers driving click through rates and general customer responsiveness. This colour is therefore ideal for this website design to attract attention. I used it for the most important buttons across the pages and a couple if icons in the nev menu.

 - #004040  - Cyprus, light blue colour - also known as process colour, used in colour printing, comprises 100.0% cyan, 0.0% magenta, 0.0% yellow, and 74.9% key (black). This colour was selected as it compliments the overall colour and background of the page. The choice here was therefore a stylistic one rather than a choice driven by consumer behaviour.

 - #01796f - Pine Green colour -  composed of 0% red, 52% green and 48% blue. Pine green colour from Crayola is named after the colour of the pine trees. This colour is described as "dark gray". Pine green represents simplistic, sleepy, graceful. This colour was selected as it compliments the overall colour and background of the page. In addition this website sells outdoor products to consumers who are looking to go camping with what this colour represents likely matching customer expectations around their own future camping trips with these products.  


**Typography**

The following google fonts have been chosen for this project:

 - For the logo I used: 'Comic Neue', cursive style (for the
   'Camping' part of logo), as well as for the motto text on the home
   page


 - 'Lato', sans-serif style was used for the 'Eco' style in the logo
   part. 


 - 'Montserrat', sans-serif; was chosen for the rest of the project.
   'Montserrat' is one of the most web safe fonts. I decided to use
   it in order to keep the traditional design.


**Imagery**


-   I used in this project the pictures of products from another retailer. Most of it came from https://ecopath.io/


- Parallax image has been implemented in the about section on the home page, the same image has also been used on the company policies screen. 

    
-   I have used a hero image on the home page to the give the site a dramatic appearance. Category images have been used for the featured products section on the home page to give a visual representation of what the companies products are intended for. Parallax images and product detail background images are in keeping with the company name.


### WIREFRAMES


[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was the tool used in this project to create low-fidelity wireframes.


[EcoCamping Wireframes](media/ecocamping-wireframes.png)


Note: During the design stage, I decided to make some changes in order to provide a better user experience. 

## DATABASE  SCHEMA

During the development stage of the project, SQLite relational database was used as this is the default database included with Django. 

In production, I used PostgreSQL, which is included with Heroku.

**Database Diagram** below presents all apps and Data Models.

- Users then scrolls down to 'About' section, where they can read about EcoCamping wishes as well as the company values. There is a parallax image below this section.
- On the bottom of the page there are product category cards - I user responsive flip cards using bootstrap4 and JS (link in 'Credits' section). 

**Products Page**

- Products layout is similar to the Boutique Ado project, I followed the same responsive design, with 1 product per row on small devices, two products per row on small tablets, and 4 products per row on medium sized devices and upwards. 

- All products screen has got the number of all products on the page on the top left corner. On the top right hand corner user can sort products by price, rating, alphabetically, and by category. Each product has got its name and price. Category is assigned to each product as well, and if a user clicks on the category name, it will take the user to all products belonging to that category. Each product has also got its rating assigned to it on the main products page. Only superusers can see 'Edit' or 'Delete' links next to each product. 
- Once users click on the specific product image, it will take them to the product detail page. 
- A Back to top button is on the products page, located in the bottom right hand corner. 

**Product Detail Page**
- On the product details page, users not only see the same as above, but they can also:
- View the product description
- If they wish to buy the product they can choose quantity and size (if applicable)
- If a user decides not to buy the product, they can select the button 'Keep shopping' to go back to all products.
- If users click 'Add to Bag' button, the toast message 'Success' will appear on the top right hand corner of the screen with the details of what the user has just put in their bag. If that is the only product they wish to buy, they can click 'Go to secure checkout".

**Shopping Bag Page**
- This page includes:
-- Product image
-- Product info, including size as well as SKU number
-- Price
-- Quantity - Where users can amend the number of products they wish to purchase, or remove the product from their shopping bag
-- At the bottom of the screen on the right hand corner users can see bag total, delivery cost (if less than delivery threshold), and grand total. 
-- Users have access to two buttons: 'Keep Shopping', if they decide to search for more products, and 'Secure Checkout' Button that takes them to the checkout page.

**Checkout Page**
- This page includes:
- The order summary (which shows the number of products in the shopping bag in brackets):
- Overview of each product. If users click on the image, it will take them back to that product's page. Users also see a breakdown of the total order, delivery and grand total. 
 - The form that users are asked to fill out includes sections such as: 
      - Details, Delivery and, and Payment. 
- If users want to change their mind, they can click on 'Adjust bag' button. 
- If users wish to proceed with the purchase, they need to click on 'Complete The Order' button. 

**Checkout Success Page**

Once users make their purchase, they receive a notification about successful order processed and that the confirmation email will be sent to their email.
On the same screen they will see order information, order details, delivery info, and billing info. 
Users can also click on the button to browse for more products. 

**Profile Page**
This page includes:
- Default delivery details, where users can update their own details 
- Order history, with past orders: each order includes order number, date, item, order total. 
- If users click on one of the past orders, they get the notification to confirm that they are viewing their past order

**Contact Page**
Once users click on the 'Contact Us' link on the page footer, it takes them to the form where they can leave feedback or ask a question. To do that, they need to provide their full name, email, subject, and message. 
If they change their mind they can cancel sending the message. 'Send message' button will send the message to the online store team. Once the message has been sent, users get a pop up notification ('success' toast) confirming message has been set and that a copy of the message will be sent to the user's email. 
Only superusers can access users' messages via Django Admin page.

Users have also got an option to subscribe. They can access the form from the footer of the page. The form requires their email only. Once they click the 'Subscribe' button, they get a notification confirming they have subscribed to EcoCamping newsletter, and that the confirmation has gone out to their email. 

**Allauth Features**

Django Allauth set the login, register, email confirmation pages etc. I have amended it in order to align with EcoCamping styles / UX. 

**Features available to superusers**
- Superusers can access additional link under My Account icon on the page header. Once clicked, it will take the superuser to the 'Add a Product' screen. Once a product has been added, superusers can update or delete the product. 
- Superusers can access Django Admin Page where they have the ability to:
 -- check and manage contact messages from users
 -- manage subscribers
 -- manage users' orders
 -- manage products and categories / view, add, edit or delete them
